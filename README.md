# Calculator
I’ve always enjoyed solving quick math problems, and creating a calculator felt like the perfect way to bring that interest into code. This project allowed me to combine functionality with design, making a clean and responsive calculator for everyday use.

The calculator handles basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — with a smooth interface and instant results. Whether you’re crunching numbers for fun or function, this tool is meant to be fast, accurate, and easy to use.
